# Project BIO485 - MR Aceleration - Solving a inverse problem

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial diagnostic tool that allows us to capture detailed images of the inside of our body. However, acquiring these images often takes a long time. One way to speed up this process is by skipping certain lines in the k-space data beyond the Nyquist limit. While this reduces scanning time, it also introduces undesirable artifacts in the images.  

This project explores a method to skip lines in the k-space domain by treating the problem as an inverse problem. The goal is to reconstruct the best high-resolution image-x from the undersampled k-space data-s. This problem can be expressed mathematically as:  

$$
f(x) = \min \|s - Ex\|_2^2 + \lambda \|x\|_2^2
$$  

Where:  
- \(s\) is the undersampled data,  
- \(x\) is the high-resolution image,  
- \(E\) combines the undersampling mask, coil sensitivity, and Fourier transform,  
- \(\lambda\) is a regularization term.  

The project explores simple 1D and 2D examples to address this problem. It focuses on reconstructing \(x\) (the high-resolution image) using methods such as the pseudoinverse matrix and gradient descent.
